#
# Verifies that the hand-maintained `workflow_dispatch` `scope` choice
# dropdowns in the release workflows match the authoritative set of release
# scopes declared in scripts/release/release.config.json (`.scopes` keys).
#
# Why this matters: the release workflows expose a `scope` input as a
# `type: choice` with a hard-coded `options:` list. That list is supposed to
# be "regenerated from release.config.json", but nothing enforced it — so as
# packages were enrolled/renamed in release.config.json the dropdowns drifted
# (newly-enrolled packages weren't canary-selectable; stale scopes lingered).
# This guard fails CI whenever a dropdown diverges from the config.
#
# Three files are checked:
#   .github/workflows/publish-release.yml  — canary/prerelease `scope` input
#   .github/workflows/prepare-release.yml  — create-pr `scope` input
#   .github/workflows/canary.yml           — one-click canary orchestrator `scope` input
#
# Sentinel exception: neither workflow uses a non-scope sentinel option (no
# `all` / `canary` pseudo-scope — an empty/omitted scope is handled outside
# the options list). If a sentinel is ever introduced, add it to
# SENTINELS below so it is excluded from the equality check.
#
# THIRD scope projection guarded here: publish-release.yml's `notify` job has a
# `Compute release intent` step whose `case "$SCOPE"` maps a dispatch scope to
# its ecosystem (NuGet vs PyPI vs npm) for FAILURE paging. That step runs before
# checkout, so it cannot read release.config.json at runtime and instead carries
# static lists for the exceptional scopes. check_notify_case below asserts those
# lists project every config scope to the correct ecosystem, so this
# hand-maintained list cannot drift.
