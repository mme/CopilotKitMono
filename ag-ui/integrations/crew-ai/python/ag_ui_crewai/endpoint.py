    Used in the ``finally`` block of the event generators so that a client
    disconnect (which closes the generator) tears down the kickoff coroutine
    instead of leaking it.

    Semantics:
    - A SINGLE shared monotonic deadline (``_cancel_join_timeout_seconds``)
      bounds the combined wait of (grace window + force-cancel join +
      outer-cancel recovery). There is one ceiling window for the entire
      teardown, not three (finding #7).
    - If ``allow_grace`` and the task is mid-flight on a happy path, wait up
      to ``min(_CANCEL_GRACE_SECONDS, remaining-budget)`` for it to finish
      on its own (the FlowFinishedEvent listener enqueues ``None``
      microseconds before ``kickoff_async`` actually returns). A quick
      ``sleep(0)`` + ``task.done()`` probe fast-paths the common case where
      the task is microseconds from returning, so happy-path requests do
      NOT systematically pay the 1s grace latency tax (finding #9).
    - The grace wait is SHIELDED and protected by the same outer-cancel
      recovery pattern used post-grace (finding #5). If the caller is
      cancelled during the grace wait, ``task.cancel()`` still fires via
      the ``finally`` and the task is cleanly unwound within the remaining
      budget; we don't leave a cancelled-but-unjoined task behind.
    - We deliberately do NOT catch ``BaseException``. ``SystemExit`` /
      ``KeyboardInterrupt`` / ``CancelledError`` must propagate; we only
      swallow ``TimeoutError`` (explicitly) and recoverable ``Exception``
      subclasses from the task itself.
    - On Python 3.11+, catching ``CancelledError`` does NOT decrement
      ``Task.cancelling()``: any subsequent ``await`` re-raises immediately
      unless we call ``asyncio.current_task().uncancel()``. Without that,
      the bounded recovery wait in the CancelledError branch is defeated
      (re-raises on entry). We invoke ``uncancel`` via ``getattr`` so the

    CR6-7 MEDIUM: ``QUEUES_LOCK`` is intentionally NOT taken here.

    Contract:
    * ``QUEUES`` is a plain ``dict`` keyed by the per-flow UUID hex
      stored on the flow as ``_agui_queue_key`` (CR8 MEDIUM). CPython's
      GIL makes ``dict.get(k)`` atomic at the bytecode level — we
      cannot observe a half-constructed mapping. CR7 LOW: this assumes
      a CPython-with-GIL interpreter. Free-threaded CPython 3.13+ (PEP
      703, opt-in ``--disable-gil``) removes the bytecode-atomicity
      guarantee and would require wrapping the read in a
      ``threading.Lock`` (or migrating ``QUEUES`` to a thread-safe
      mapping). This is forward-compat documentation only — the module
      does not ship free-thread support today.
    * CR7 MEDIUM (threading model): crewai's ``CrewAIEventsBus`` emits
      listener callbacks SYNCHRONOUSLY from whatever call stack raised
      the event. In our code path the events are raised from within
      ``kickoff_async`` — which we ``await`` on the event loop — so in
      practice listeners always run on the loop thread. The prior
      docstring warned callers that callbacks may run from a non-loop
      thread, which implied ``queue.put_nowait`` in the listener
      callbacks was unsafe. That warning was conservative to the point
      of being misleading: in the current architecture every listener
      callback fires on the loop thread, so ``put_nowait`` is the right
      primitive. If crewai ever invokes the bus from a worker thread
      (e.g. a future background-executor feature), every ``put_nowait``
      call site in ``FastAPICrewFlowEventListener.setup_listeners`` must
      be revisited and converted to ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` — but
      there is no such path today.
    * This function is called from TWO contexts:
      (a) Synchronous crewai event-listener callbacks. Those run on the
          event loop thread (see threading model note above), but via
          synchronous call stacks where we cannot ``await`` — hence no
          ``QUEUES_LOCK`` acquisition.
      (b) The async endpoint code paths, which always take
          ``QUEUES_LOCK`` for writes (``create_queue``, ``delete_queue``)
          but not reads.
    * The one race that remains is SEMANTIC rather than data-structural:
      a late listener callback that fires after ``delete_queue`` has
      removed the entry will observe ``None`` and silently no-op. This
      is the intended behaviour — an event for a torn-down flow has
      nowhere to land. The ``_cancel_and_join`` teardown widens the
      window during which late callbacks can arrive after delete, but
      does not change the semantics: late events were already lost on
      the happy-path, and continue to be lost here.
    * A flow that was never registered with ``create_queue`` (e.g. a
      listener callback routed to an unrelated Flow) will not carry
      the ``_agui_queue_key`` attribute; we default to ``None`` and
      the ``get`` returns ``None`` as intended.

                * After each pass we yield one scheduler tick
                  (``asyncio.sleep(0)``) — UNCONDITIONALLY, regardless of
                  whether the pass drained anything — so any

                  until the cumulative ``_DRAIN_BUDGET_SECONDS`` wall
                  clock is exhausted — whichever comes first. This
                  covers listener chains that need multiple scheduler
                  ticks to materialise their enqueue (e.g. a listener
                  callback that itself schedules another ``call_soon``).
